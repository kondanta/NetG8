### Network Scanner


So let me briefly explain the dependencies. It requires nmap and scapy installed through python package manager.
`pip install > requirements.txt`
Also one function requires unix operating system for run.

### Functions and Usages
Since program has simple UI, it wouldn't be a problem to figure out how it does things.
However; There are some restrictions I'd like to mention.
- First of all you `SHOULD` use first 4 functions with an order. They all depends eachother's results.
- Finding OSs and Routers are not compatible with Windows OS yet.
- Syn Flood Attack automatically triggers the tcpdump. That's why `I assume that you already have that. `
- Sniff function does sniff the local network (as you can guess from the name) and prints the result. However there are several options you can choose among them. I believe sniff menu is self-explanatory.


### Installation
Just clone/download the repository and run the main.py.
`It'll require super user permissions to run sucessfully`. Without sudo, you can do basic scans though.
